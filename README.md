# fishrecognizer
I created a fairly large database of fish images. It consists 27 fish species, with an average of 1000 items per species, some more. I created a fish recognition model using Transfer Learning and EfficientB2. The results and database shared here are just a small part of the project, as I want to create a marketable application from this in the end.
