# fishrecognizer
I created a fairly large database of fish images. It consists 27 fish species, with an average of 1000 items per species, some more. I created a fish recognition model using Transfer Learning and EfficientB2. The results and database shared here are just a small part of the project, as I want to create a marketable application from this in the end.
The training images used in this project can be downloaded from the following Google Drive link:
👉 [Download fish images from Google Drive](https://drive.google.com/drive/folders/1hpxNz4dz8fUhOJwtumNsEbl78EmxwJLs?usp=sharing)
After downloading, extract the folder and place it in the `data/` directory before running the training scripts.
